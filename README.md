# Functions-PRN
## Aim
To get PRN from user and display it using functions.
## Description
In this experiment, two functions are used. One function is used to get the PRN from the user and the other is used to display the PRN. We use the data type of "long long int" for PRN since it is a 11 digit number that does not fall in the range of int, double etc.
